				<i>My Dear Eddie,</i>
			</p>
			<p>Whatever view a story-teller may take of his business, ’tis happy when he can think, “This book of mine will please such and such a friend,” and may set that friend’s name after the title page. For even if to please (as some are beginning to hold) should be no part of his aim, at least ’twill always be a reward: and (in unworthier moods) next to a Writer I would choose to be a Lamplighter, as the only other that gets so cordial a “God bless him!” in the long winter evenings.</p>
			<p>To win such a welcome at such a time from a new friend or two would be the happiest fortune for my tale. But to you I could wish it to speak particularly, seeing that under the coat of <b>Jack Marvel</b> beats the heart of your friend</p>
