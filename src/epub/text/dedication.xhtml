<i>MY DEAR EDDIE,</i>
</h3>
<p>
      Whatever view a story-teller may take of his business, ’tis happy when he
      can think, “This book of mine will please such and such a friend,” and may
      set that friend’s name after the title page. For even if to please (as
      some are beginning to hold) should be no part of his aim, at least ’twill
      always be a reward: and (in unworthier moods) next to a Writer I would
      choose to be a Lamplighter, as the only other that gets so cordial a “God
      bless him!” in the long winter evenings.

<p>
      To win such a welcome at such a time from a new friend or two would be the
      happiest fortune for my tale. But to you I could wish it to speak
      particularly, seeing that under the coat of JACK MARVEL <i>beats the heart
      of your friend</i>
